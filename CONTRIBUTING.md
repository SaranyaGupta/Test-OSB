## Handbook for Contributors and Maintainers

### Maintainers

[Software Engineering Team](https://github.com/orgs/Iberia-Ent/teams/software-engineering) is the main author and maintainer of Innersource model for Iberia Organization. 

### Contribution workflow

If you'd like to write some code for innersource, the standard workflow is as follows:

1. Check that there isn't already an issue about your idea in the "Issues" tab to avoid duplicating work.
    * If there isn't one already, please create one so that others know you're working on this.
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository following the [naming convention](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/software-engineering--innersource--standards/blob/main/pages/repositories.md#fork-naming-convention) defined in the innersource repository.
3. Make the necessary changes / additions within your forked repository.
4. Submit a Pull Request against the development or integration branch like `develop` or `features` branch and wait for the code to be reviewed and merged.

If you're not used to this workflow with git, you can start with some [docs from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) or even their [excellent `git` resources](https://try.github.io/).
